A member of the group starts a pool using a command /pool and followed by the “pool Name”. 
For instance /pool Dairy from the farm

**Pool Details**
The bot asks to provide more details, for instance:
Tell us more, for instance “answer today by 13.00, collect on Wednesday 10.00, our office”
The channel member/pool moderator adds details, in text

**Pool Creation**
This creates a pool named “Dairy from the farm”
The bot says: “your pool is almost ready: go to your specific pool page on solidarityfoods.se. (“pool url”) to add a catalogue and see the pool order recap

**Upload catalogue**
The pool admin now can upload a catalogue on the pool, using the “copy from spreadsheet” function. When done, the pool is populated with the catalogue.


**Purchase items**
All the members on the slack channel who want to purchase the products make an order. This is done by each member going to the pool page and changing quantities of each item they want.

**Closing a pool**
Pool moderator closes pool . Bot says: “go to (pool url) to see the order recap” where there is a of:
Individual order lists: who wants what, with total to pay
Total order list: by items, quantity, total to pay
